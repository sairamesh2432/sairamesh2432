## Experience



### Project 1: HybridSPRT - A/B Test Experiment Optimization
- **Description**: Developed the HybridSPRT, a sequential testing algorithm to reduce A/B test experiment runtimes by up to 60%. Created a detailed report on the method, leading to a publication on the Data@Atlassian Medium blog (in-progress).
- **GitHub Repository**: [HybridSPRT](https://github.com/sairamesh2432/hybridsprt)
- **Summary**: Implemented HybridSPRT in Python, documented extensively, and validated using Databricks notebook. Reduced experiment runtimes by over 20 days.
- **Skills**: Python, A/B Testing, Data Analysis, Databricks, Statistical Methods

### Project 2: Real-time Database Job Runtimes Prediction
- **Description**: Productionized an end-to-end machine learning workflow to predict runtimes of key database jobs in real-time at Ford Motor Company. Reduced time needed to inform stakeholders of long-running jobs by over 90%.
- **GitHub Repository**: [Real-time Runtimes Prediction](https://github.com/sairamesh2432/realtime-runtimes-prediction)
- **Summary**: Created a Python module, Flask API, and Docker container for model deployment. Achieved 100% evaluation score and collaborated with cross-functional teams.
- **Skills**: Machine Learning, Python, Flask, Docker, Collaboration

### Project 3: Autonomous Vehicle Mapping with Faster R-CNN
- **Description**: Trained a PyTorch-based Faster R-CNN object detection model to detect traffic objects. Utilized K-means clustering to geotag traffic objects with <1-meter error from real-world location.
- **GitHub Repository**: [Autonomous Vehicle Mapping](https://github.com/sairamesh2432/autonomous-vehicle-mapping)
- **Summary**: Developed reusable Python codebase and presented results to Ford's AI Advancement Center. Improved object detection and mapping accuracy.
- **Skills**: Deep Learning, PyTorch, Computer Vision, Python

## Skills
